      <description>My first post in this blog wasn&amp;rsquo;t to be a praise for Linux, but instead instructions for a smooth way of having Docker in a machine with Apple Silicon. M1, M2, you know.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 5 years since I discovered the magic of static blogs and tried to set up this website to use some of this magic. However, I had nothing to say and the project was put aside. This time I think I might have something interesting to publish.
